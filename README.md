Abstract:
The primary sources and drivers of recent observed summer Arctic moistening trends are still unclear, which represents a substantial research gap hindering attribution and detection of observed Arctic warming, through its in-season radiative effects and delayed impacts on sea ice loss and surface heat absorption. Using combined water tagging and circulation nudging techniques, we find that trends in Northern Hemisphere summertime large-scale circulation and land capacitor processes drive moistening of the Arctic over recent decades. Circulation directs more atmospheric rivers (ARs) poleward, traveling from the tropics to the Arctic by passing through the high latitude land surface, referred to as the land capacitor effect. We attribute 94% of the summertime water vapor feedback to transport from these remote sources using a radiative kernel approach. A North American pathway originates from the tropical Atlantic, transported poleward by anticyclones over the subtropics and Greenland, and released through summertime evapotranspiration over northeastern North America. In contrast, overlying anticyclonic circulation over western and central Eurasia enhances evapotranspiration and redistributes moisture deposited during the preceding winter and spring, to the Arctic during summer. Thus, the impacts of large-scale circulation on ARs and diverse land-atmosphere interactions over high latitudes should be considered to explain the underlying mechanisms of the recent moistening and warming in the Arctic and beyond.
