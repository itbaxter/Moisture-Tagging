DESCRIPTION:
# Moisture-Tagging
Repository for code generated during our nudged moisture tagging study.

We use iCESM1.2 with the nominal 1- and 2-degree resolution, along with nudging to ERA5
winds.

Scipts for figures and analysis prepared for a manuscript in revision. Code is in python with versions in regular python scripts and rendered jupyter notebooks.
